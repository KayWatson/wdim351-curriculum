1. 3a: In prep for class discussion next week, read either (or both, if you're awesome):
  1. For designers: [Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution)
  1. For devs: [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to HTTP and REST](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/a-beginners-introduction-to-http-and-rest/)

2. 3b: Meet George. He runs Hollywood Fitness up on Sandy and here is his website: [http://hollywoodfitness.net/](http://hollywoodfitness.net/). His entire online strategy needs an overhaul. He is a real person with a real business that needs real dev, design, strategy. You are in the Gather stage of the project cycle with George. Generate 15 questions you have for clarification in hopes of moving into the Sketch and Planning phase. Ask me any questions you have on G+. Post these questions as class_03/README.md in your team's GitHub repo.

> Hi Chris,

> Thanks again for meeting with me on Monday.  You have given me new energy and a focus for the year ahead.  As you know, it is a minefield for business owners these days with all of the technology changing, practically daily.

> I will try to outline, however poorly, the current situation and hopes for the gym.

> 1. Problem of Giants Gym losing indexing, and even showing being closed on google.
2. Would like to have a page for videos tied to a program for members.  They report once a week on progress and people can view each member and their progress, perhaps even commenting.
3. Create simple program that allows staff and members to create video and upload at the gym.
4. Tie this and other programs to a rewards program that can be tracked, each member can earn points towards prizes and stuff.
5. Create a single page making it easy for members to share reviews.
6. Find a way to drive more email traffic to our newsletter for building base.
7. Target local businesses with a special program just for them
8. Describe why our gym really is different.
9. Tie facebook, website, newsletter, etc. together so we don't have to repeat entries.
10. Rewrite copy for letters used in autoresponder
11. Create (or use) some type of software for all follow up and service calls for members.

> Okay, I really don't know how to look at this with an unbiased eye.  I know we need drive traffic and make us "fun".

> My staff doesn't have a system that always works for follow up and service.  We have three options to make more money......get more members, get members to spend more money, and keep members longer.

> All of the above should be for that purpose.

> I take great pride in delivering more for the money, really making someone feel special, and that we care.

> I want the worth analysis to be a no brainer.
